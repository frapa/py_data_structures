# Python Data Structures 

This is a collection of data structures implemented in Python
as an exercise for the coding interviews.

Apart from data structures, there is also a bunch of algorithms
running on them, to exercise their implementation.

# Overview

The package contains some simple but good quality implementation
of the data structures, including basic tests.

The following data structures are implemented:

- [Linked Lists](./src/data_structures/linked_list.py)
- [Stack](./src/data_structures/stack.py)
- [Queue](./src/data_structures/queue.py) - Circular and Linked Lists
- [Deque (double-ended queue)](./src/data_structures/queue.py) - Circular and Linked Lists
- [Graph](./src/data_structures/graph.py)

The following algorithms are implemented:

- [Depth-first search](./src/algorithms/graph_search.py) - Both recursive and iterative variant 
  (the last one is 10x faster and does not cause max stack depth errors for large graphs). 
- [Breadth-first search](./src/algorithms/graph_search.py)
