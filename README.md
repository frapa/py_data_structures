# Python Data Structures 

This is a collection of data structures implemented in Python
as an exercise for the coding interviews.

Apart from data structures, there is also a bunch of algorithms
running on them, to exercise their implementation.

# Overview

The package contains some simple but good quality implementation
of the data structures, including basic tests.

The following data structures are there:

- Linked Lists
- Stack
- Queue - Circular and Linked Lists
- Deque (double-ended queue) - Circular and Linked Lists
